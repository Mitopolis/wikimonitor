WIKIMONITOR OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
To operate WikiMonitor, follow the following steps:
*Place it in a directory that...
**Is dedicated (nothing else is in it)
**Has write permissions (PHP needs to be able to read/write the file cookies.txt)
*Create the file "conf/logininfo.php" (see below)
*Run the file "main.php" with the command-line code "php -f main.php" (add your PHP directory to the PATH if the command isn't recognized)
*Do not close the command shell window (doing so will stop executing the script)
*Restart the script every 7 days or so

The file "conf/logininfo" should look like this:
<?php
$wikiusername = 'WikiMonitor'; //replace with the username you are using
$wikipassword = 'password'; //replace with your password
